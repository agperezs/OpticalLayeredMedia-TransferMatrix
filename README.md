# OpticalLayeredMedia-TransferMatrix

GUI with transfer matrix implementation for DBR Optical devices.
The objective of the project is the design and implementation of a tool to assist experimental researchers in the area of DBR filter design. A tool is needed that, given a number of 2-layer components (characterized by their refractive indices) provides the estimation of the transmitted (Tx), reflected (Rx) and absorbed (Ax) spectra, storing the results and having graphical capabilities for comparison against sets of experimentally obtained measurements.
